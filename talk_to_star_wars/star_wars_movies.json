I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office."], ["PADME", "Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her."], ["ANAKIN", "I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways."], ["PADME", "I think so too."], ["QUEEN JAMILLIA", "We've been worried about you.

I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote."], ["SIO BIBBLE", "Given the circumstances, Senator, you know it was the only decision Her Highness could have made."], ["QUEEN JAMILLIA", "How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?"], ["PADME", "About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war."], ["SIO BIBBLE", "It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic!"], ["QUEEN JAMILLIA", "Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?"], ["PADME", "Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help."], ["QUEEN JAMILLIA", "The armies of commerce! Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?"], ["PADME", "I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds."], ["SIO BIBBLE", "It's outrageous! After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?"], ["QUEEN JAMILLIA", "Remember, Counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. That's a move in the right direction."], ["PADME", "There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered."], ["ANAKIN", "The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told."], ["QUEEN JAMILLIA", "We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it."], ["PADME", "Let's pray that day never comes."], ["QUEEN JAMILLIA", "In the meantime, we must consider your own safety."], ["SIO BIBBLE", "(to Anakin) What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?"], ["PADME", "Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking..."], ["ANAKIN", "(nettled) Hey, hold on a minute!"], ["PADME", "Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated."], ["ANAKIN", "Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady."], ["PADME", "Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance."], ["ANAKIN", "(takes a deep breath) Sorry, M'Lady."], ["SIO BIBBLE", "(to Anakin, amused) She is right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain."], ["QUEEN JAMILLIA", "Perfect. It's settled then."], ["QUEEN JAMILLIA", "(continued) Padm\u00e9, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave... your family's very worried about you."], ["JOCASTA NU", "Did you call for assistance?"], ["OBI-WAN", "(distracted in thought) Yes... yes, I did..."], ["JOCASTA NU", "He has a powerful face, doesn't he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing."], ["OBI-WAN", "I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order."], ["JOCASTA NU", "(sighs) The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the Order."], ["OBI-WAN", "What happened?"], ["JOCASTA NU", "Well, one might say, he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council... much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn."], ["OBI-WAN", "(surprised) Really?"], ["JOCASTA NU", "Oh, yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers... idealists..."], ["JOCASTA NU", "(continuing He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was... unique. In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement."], ["OBI-WAN", "Interesting... I'm still not sure I understand."], ["JOCASTA NU", "Well, I'm sure you didn't call me over here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?"], ["OBI-WAN", "Yes, I'm trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts."], ["JOCASTA NU", "Kamino? It's not a system I'M familiar with...

It sounds like the kind of directions you'd get from a street tout... some old miner or Furbog trader."], ["OBI-WAN", "All three actually."], ["JOCASTA NU", "Are you sure it exists?"], ["OBI-WAN", "Absolutely."], ["JOCASTA NU", "Let me do a gravitational scan."], ["JOCASTA NU", "There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet you're looking for was destroyed."], ["OBI-WAN", "Wouldn't that be on record?"], ["JOCASTA NU", "It ought to be. Unless it was very recent. (shakes her head) I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist."], ["OBI-WAN", "That's impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete."], ["JOCASTA NU", "The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!"], ["PADME", "There's my house!"], ["PADME", "(continuing) What?

Now it's done."], ["SOLA", "Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home?"], ["PADME", "(rolls her eyes) Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me."], ["JOVAL", "A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They didn't tell us it was that serious!"], ["PADME", "It's not, Mom, I promise. (glances at Jobal) Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis?"], ["PADME", "(continuing) He grew up."], ["JOBAL", "Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven't you had enough of that life? I certainly have!"], ["PADME", "Mom, I'm not in any danger."], ["RUWEE", "(to Anakin) Is she?"], ["ANAKIN", "...Yes...

Have you seen the way he looks at you?"], ["PADME", "Sola - stop it!"], ["SOLA", "It's obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven't noticed?"], ["PADME", "I'm not your baby sister, Sola. Anakin and I are friends... our relationship is strictly professional.

Home was always where my Mom was."], ["ANAKIN", "(continuing) Is this you?"], ["PADME", "That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula, which means sweethear. He was so full of life,.

Now stop it!"], ["PADME", "(continuing) Anakin!!"], ["ANAKIN", "I'm not really supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be very grumpy."], ["ANAKIN", "May I tell you something?"], ["PADME", "I don't know."], ["ANAKIN", "Then how can I tell you?"], ["PADME", "Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition."], ["ANAKIN", "It doesn't work around you.

There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that."], ["PADME", "Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me."], ["ANAKIN", "I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else.

I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it."], ["ANAKIN", "The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve."], ["OBI-WAN", "No, it is not.

They want to know what he's up to."], ["ANAKIN", "They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!"], ["OBI-WAN", "We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not."], ["ANAKIN", "Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?"], ["OBI-WAN", "This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally."], ["ANAKIN", "The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here."], ["OBI-WAN", "That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired."], ["ANAKIN", "Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer."], ["OBI-WAN", "Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place."], ["ANAKIN", "You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?"], ["OBI-WAN", "The Council is asking you."], ["OBI-WAN", "Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm."], ["YODA", "Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers."], ["MACE WINDU", "It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him."], ["OBI-WAN", "He'll be all right. I trust him with my life."], ["MACE WINDU", "I wish I did."], ["OBI-WAN", "With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?"], ["MACE WINDU", "So the prophecy says."], ["YODA", "A prophecy . . . that misread could have been."], ["OBI-WAN", "He will not let me down. He never has."], ["YODA", "I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you."], ["PADME", "Thank you, Captain."], ["CAPTAIN TYPHO", "Rest well. My Lady."], ["PADME", "I'll be up in a while."], ["MOTEE", "Yes, my lady."], ["THREEPIO", "Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?"], ["PADME", "Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio."], ["ANAKIN", "Beautiful, isn't it?"], ["PADME", "You startled me."], ["ANAKIN", "How are you feeling?"], ["PADME", "He keeps kicking."], ["ANAKIN", "He?! Why do you think it's a boy?"], ["PADME", "(laughs) My motherly intuition."], ["ANAKIN", "Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl."], ["PADME", "I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you."], ["ANAKIN", "I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master."], ["PADME", "Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills."], ["ANAKIN", "They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem."], ["PADME", "Anakin . . ."], ["ANAKIN", "Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic."], ["PADME", "Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?"], ["ANAKIN", "(suspicious) What do you mean?"], ["PADME", "What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?"], ["ANAKIN", "I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!"], ["PADME", "Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume."], ["ANAKIN", "(growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!"], ["PADME", "What is it?"], ["ANAKIN", "Nothing."], ["PADME", "Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you."], ["ANAKIN", "You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you."], ["ANAKIN", "(continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me."], ["PADME", "I sense there are things you are not telling me."], ["PADME", "(continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war."], ["ANAKIN", "You wanted to see me, Chancellor."], ["PALPATINE", "Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system."], ["ANAKIN", "At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war."], ["PALPATINE", "I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far \u2026 but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing."], ["ANAKIN", "They try."], ["PALPATINE", "Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us."], ["PALPATINE", "(continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will."], ["ANAKIN", "I'm not sure I understand."], ["PALPATINE", "You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me."], ["ANAKIN", "I don't think . . ."], ["PALPATINE", "Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?"], ["ANAKIN", "I know they don't trust you . . ."], ["PALPATINE", "Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter."], ["ANAKIN", "I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken."], ["PALPATINE", "Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?"], ["PALPATINE", "(continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?"], ["ANAKIN", "I don't know ... I don't know what to say."], ["PALPATINE", "Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. \"All those who gain power are afraid to lose it.\" Even the Jedi."], ["ANAKIN", "The Jedi use their power for good."], ["PALPATINE", "Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . ."], ["ANAKIN", ". . . evil."], ["PALPATINE", ". . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful."], ["ANAKIN", "The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves."], ["PALPATINE", "And the Jedi don't?"], ["ANAKIN", "The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others."], ["PALPATINE", "Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?"], ["ANAKIN", "I'm not sure it's wrong."], ["PALPATINE", "Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith."], ["PALPATINE", "(continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis \"the wise\"?"], ["ANAKIN", "No."], ["PALPATINE", "I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying."], ["ANAKIN", "He could actually save people from death?"], ["PALPATINE", "The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural."], ["ANAKIN", "What happened to him?"], ["PALPATINE", "He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself."], ["ANAKIN", "Is it possible to learn this power?"], ["PALPATINE", "Not from a Jedi."], ["MACE WINDU", "(holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there."], ["ANAKIN", "A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau."], ["YODA", "Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed."], ["OBI-WAN", "Does everyone agree?"], ["ANAKIN", "The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign."], ["MACE WINDU", "(a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor."], ["YODA", "A Master is needed, with more experience."], ["MACE WINDU", "Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi."], ["ANAKIN", "He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous."], ["ANAKIN", "(continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact."], ["OBI-WAN", "Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat."], ["YODA", "Obi-Wan, my choice is."], ["YODA", "I agree."], ["MACE WINDU", "Very well. Council is adjourned."], ["MACE WINDU", "(continuing) Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him."], ["CLONE COMMANDER GREE", "The droids have started up their main power generators."], ["YODA", "Then now the time is, Commander."], ["CLONE COMMANDER GREE", "Yes, sir."], ["OBI-WAN", "Has Anakin been to see you?"], ["PADME", "Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council."], ["OBI-WAN", "I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted."], ["PADME", "You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?"], ["OBI-WAN", "You should be a Jedi, Padme."], ["PADME", "You're not very good at hiding your feelings."], ["OBI-WAN", "It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you."], ["PADME", "Why would he talk to me about his work?"], ["OBI-WAN", "Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either."], ["PADME", "Don't give me that look."], ["OBI-WAN", "I know how he feels about you."], ["PADME", "(nervous) What did he say?"], ["OBI-WAN", "Nothing.

I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master."], ["OBI-WAN", "(continuing) Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau.

We'll take that one."], ["LUKE", "Yeah, take it away."], ["THREEPIO", "Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition.

You're my only hope."], ["LUKE", "What's this?"], ["THREEPIO", "What is what?!? He asked you a question... (pointing to Leia) What is that?"], ["LEIA", "Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.

I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?"], ["THREEPIO", "I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?"], ["LUKE", "Well, I don't know anyone named Obi- Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit."], ["LUKE", "I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing."], ["THREEPIO", "He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording."], ["LUKE", "H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay."], ["LUKE", "There you go."], ["LUKE", "Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message."], ["THREEPIO", "What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!"], ["AUNT BERU", "Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!"], ["LUKE", "All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru."], ["THREEPIO", "I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter."], ["LUKE", "Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back."], ["THREEPIO", "(to Artoo) Just you reconsider playing that message for him."], ["THREEPIO", "No, I don't think he likes you at all."], ["THREEPIO", "No, I don't like you either."], ["LUKE", "You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen."], ["OWEN", "What makes you think that?"], ["LUKE", "Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi."], ["LUKE", "I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben."], ["OWEN", "That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now."], ["LUKE", "But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?"], ["OWEN", "He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father."], ["LUKE", "He knew my father?"], ["OWEN", "I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers."], ["LUKE", "Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year."], ["OWEN", "You mean the next semester before harvest?"], ["LUKE", "Sure, there're more than enough droids."], ["OWEN", "Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year."], ["OWEN", "You must understand I need you here, Luke."], ["LUKE", "But it's a whole 'nother year."], ["OWEN", "Look, it's only one more season."], ["LUKE", "Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left."], ["AUNT BERU", "Where are you going?"], ["LUKE", "It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids."], ["AUNT BERU", "Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him."], ["OWEN", "I'll make it up to him next year. I promise."], ["AUNT BERU", "Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him."], ["OWEN", "That's what I'm afraid of."], ["LUKE", "What are you doing hiding there?"], ["THREEPIO", "It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission."], ["LUKE", "Oh, no!"], ["THREEPIO", "That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times."], ["LUKE", "How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!"], ["THREEPIO", "Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?"], ["LUKE", "It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning."], ["OWEN", "Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night."], ["LUKE", "All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it."], ["LUKE", "You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble."], ["THREEPIO", "Oh, he excels at that, sir."], ["OWEN", "Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now!"], ["OWEN", "Have you seen Luke this morning?"], ["AUNT BERU", "He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early."], ["OWEN", "Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?"], ["AUNT BERU", "I think so."], ["OWEN", "Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay!"], ["LUKE", "(yelling) How's that."], ["LUKE", "Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must have missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well."], ["THREEPIO", "Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault."], ["LUKE", "(brightening) Sure. He needs you. He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so..."], ["THREEPIO", "Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt..."], ["LUKE", "Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator."], ["LUKE", "Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?"], ["THREEPIO", "Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here."], ["LUKE", "Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up."], ["THREEPIO", "If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop."], ["LUKE", "No, he's not going to try anything."], ["LUKE", "What's wrong with him now?"], ["THREEPIO", "Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast."], ["LUKE", "Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on."], ["LUKE", "There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now."], ["BEN", "Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid."], ["BEN", "Don't worry, he'll be all right."], ["LUKE", "What happened?"], ["BEN", "Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece."], ["LUKE", "Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!"], ["BEN", "The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?"], ["LUKE", "Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?"], ["BEN", "Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time."], ["LUKE", "I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead."], ["BEN", "Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet."], ["LUKE", "You know him!"], ["BEN", "Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born."], ["LUKE", "Then the droid does belong to you."], ["BEN", "Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting..."], ["BEN", "I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers."], ["LUKE", "Threepio!"], ["THREEPIO", "Where am I? I must have taken a bad step..."], ["LUKE", "Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return."], ["THREEPIO", "I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for."], ["LUKE", "No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?"], ["BEN", "Quickly, son... they're on the move."], ["LUKE", "No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter."], ["BEN", "That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved."], ["LUKE", "You fought in the Clone Wars?"], ["BEN", "Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father."], ["LUKE", "I wish I'd known him."], ["BEN", "He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me..."], ["BEN", "I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did."], ["THREEPIO", "Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile."], ["LUKE", "Sure, go ahead."], ["LUKE", "What is it?"], ["BEN", "Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster."], ["BEN", "An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire."], ["LUKE", "How did my father die?"], ["BEN", "A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force."], ["LUKE", "The Force?"], ["BEN", "Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together."], ["BEN", "Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from."], ["LUKE", "I saw part of the message he was..."], ["BEN", "I seem to have found it."], ["LEIA", "General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope."], ["BEN", "You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan."], ["LUKE", "(laughing) Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is."], ["BEN", "I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing."], ["LUKE", "I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here."], ["BEN", "That's your uncle talking."], ["LUKE", "(sighing) Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?"], ["BEN", "Learn about the Force, Luke."], ["LUKE", "Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going."], ["BEN", "You must do what you feel is right, of course."], ["TAGGE", "Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize."], ["MOTTI", "Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!"], ["TAGGE", "The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as...."], ["TARKIN", "The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away."], ["TAGGE", "That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?"], ["TARKIN", "The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station."], ["TAGGE", "And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it."], ["DARTH VADER", "The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands."], ["MOTTI", "Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!"], ["DARTH VADER", "Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force."], ["MOTTI", "Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort..."], ["DARTH VADER", "I find your lack of faith disturbing."], ["TARKIN", "Enough of this! Vader, release him!"], ["DARTH VADER", "As you wish."], ["TARKIN", "This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke."], ["LUKE", "It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before."], ["BEN", "They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers."], ["LUKE", "These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio."], ["BEN", "And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise."], ["LUKE", "Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?"], ["LUKE", "If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home!"], ["BEN", "Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous."], ["LUKE", "Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!"], ["DARTH VADER", "And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base."], ["BEN", "There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire."], ["LUKE", "I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father."], ["BEN", "Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious."], ["TROOPER", "How long have you had these droids?"], ["LUKE", "About three or four seasons."], ["BEN", "They're for sale if you want them."], ["TROOPER", "Let me see your identification."], ["BEN", "You don't need to see his identification."], ["TROOPER", "We don't need to see his identification."], ["BEN", "These are not the droids your looking for."], ["TROOPER", "These are not the droids we're looking for."], ["BEN", "He can go about his business."], ["TROOPER", "You can go about your business."], ["BEN", "(to Luke) Move along."], ["TROOPER", "Move along. Move along."], ["THREEPIO", "I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures."], ["LUKE", "Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead."], ["BEN", "The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally."], ["LUKE", "Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?"], ["BEN", "Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough."], ["LUKE", "I'm ready for anything."], ["THREEPIO", "Come along, Artoo."], ["BARTENDER", "We don't serve their kind here!"], ["LUKE", "What?"], ["BARTENDER", "Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here."], ["LUKE", "Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble."], ["THREEPIO", "I heartily agree with you sir."], ["CREATURE", "Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?"], ["HUMAN", "He doesn't like you."], ["LUKE", "I'm sorry."], ["HUMAN", "I don't like you either."], ["HUMAN", "Don't insult us. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems."], ["LUKE", "I'll be careful than."], ["HUMAN", "You'll be dead."], ["BEN", "This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something..."], ["BARTENDER", "No blasters! No blaster!"], ["BEN", "This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs."], ["THREEPIO", "I don't like the look of this."], ["HAN", "Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system."], ["BEN", "Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship."], ["HAN", "Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?"], ["BEN", "Should I have?"], ["HAN", "It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!"], ["HAN", "I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo?"], ["BEN", "Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked."], ["HAN", "What is it? Some kind of local trouble?"], ["BEN", "Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements."], ["HAN", "Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance."], ["LUKE", "Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!"], ["HAN", "But who's going to fly it, kid! You?"], ["LUKE", "You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen..."], ["BEN", "We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan."], ["HAN", "Seventeen, huh!"], ["HAN", "Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four."], ["BEN", "Ninety-four."], ["HAN", "Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork."], ["TROOPER", "All right, we'll check it out."], ["HAN", "Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready."], ["BEN", "You'll have to sell your speeder."], ["LUKE", "That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again."], ["GREEDO", "Going somewhere, Solo?"], ["HAN", "Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money."], ["GREEDO", "It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first."], ["HAN", "Yeah, but this time I got the money."], ["GREEDO", "If you give it to me, I might forget I found you."], ["HAN", "I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba..."], ["GREEDO", "Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser."], ["HAN", "Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?"], ["GREEDO", "You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship."], ["HAN", "Over my dead body."], ["GREEDO", "That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time."], ["HAN", "Yes, I'll bet you have."], ["HAN", "Sorry about the mess."], ["DARTH VADER", "Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her."], ["IMPERIAL OFFICER", "The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?"], ["TARKIN", "Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion."], ["DARTH VADER", "What do you mean?"], ["TARKIN", "I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. (to soldier) Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan."], ["TROOPER", "With pleasure."], ["THREEPIO", "Lock the door, Artoo."], ["TROOPER", "All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door."], ["THREEPIO", "I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault."], ["THREEPIO", "You watch your language!"], ["LUKE", "He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand."], ["BEN", "It will be enough."], ["BEN", "If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well."], ["JABBA", "Come on out, Solo!"], ["HAN", "I've been waiting for you, Jabba."], ["JABBA", "I expected you would be."], ["HAN", "I'm not the type to run."], ["JABBA", "(fatherly-smooth) Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together."], ["HAN", "You sent Greedo to blast me."], ["JABBA", "(mock surprise) Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business. You're too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern at your delays. He wasn't going to blast you."], ["HAN", "I think he thought he was. Next time don't send one of those twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself."], ["JABBA", "Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception. Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good business."], ["HAN", "You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time."], ["JABBA", "(to his men) Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you. So, for an extra, say twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it. If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life."], ["HAN", "Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure."], ["LUKE", "What a piece of junk."], ["HAN", "She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself."], ["HAN", "We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here."], ["THREEPIO", "Hello, sir."], ["TROOPER", "Which way?"], ["TROOPER", "All right, men. Load your weapons!"], ["TROOPER", "Stop that ship!"], ["TROOPER", "Blast 'em!"], ["HAN", "Chewie, get us out of here!"], ["THREEPIO", "Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel."], ["HAN", "It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed."], ["HAN", "Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off."], ["LUKE", "Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast."], ["HAN", "Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!"], ["HAN", "Here's where the fun begins!"], ["BEN", "How long before you can make the jump to light speed?"], ["HAN", "It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer."], ["LUKE", "Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining..."], ["HAN", "Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?"], ["LUKE", "What's that flashing?"], ["HAN", "We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed."], ["MOTTI", "We've entered the Alderaan system."], ["LEIA", "Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board."], ["TARKIN", "Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!"], ["LEIA", "I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!"], ["TARKIN", "Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now."], ["LEIA", "The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."], ["TARKIN", "Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan."], ["LEIA", "No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly..."], ["TARKIN", "You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!"], ["TARKIN", "I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?"], ["LEIA", "(softly) Dantooine."], ["LEIA", "They're on Dantooine."], ["TARKIN", "There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. (addressing Motti) Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready."], ["LEIA", "What?"], ["TARKIN", "You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough."], ["LEIA", "No!"], ["DARTH VADER", "Commence primary ignition."], ["LUKE", "Are you all right? What's wrong?"], ["BEN", "I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened."], ["BEN", "You'd better get on with your exercises."], ["HAN", "Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em."], ["HAN", "Don't everyone thank me at once."], ["HAN", "Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours."], ["THREEPIO", "Now be careful, Artoo."], ["THREEPIO", "He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you."], ["HAN", "(interrupting) Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee."], ["THREEPIO", "But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid."], ["HAN", "That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that."], ["THREEPIO", "I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win."], ["BEN", "Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him."], ["LUKE", "You mean it controls your actions?"], ["BEN", "Partially. But it also obeys your commands."], ["HAN", "Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid."], ["LUKE", "You don't believe in the Force, do you?"], ["HAN", "Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny."], ["HAN", "It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense."], ["BEN", "I suggest you try it again, Luke."], ["BEN", "This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct."], ["LUKE", "(laughing) With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight?"], ["BEN", "Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them."], ["BEN", "Stretch out with your feelings."], ["BEN", "You see, you can do it."], ["HAN", "I call it luck."], ["BEN", "In my experience, there's no such thing as luck."], ["HAN", "Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else."], ["HAN", "Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan."], ["LUKE", "You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote."], ["BEN", "That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world."], ["TARKIN", "Yes."], ["OFFICER CASS", "Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems."], ["TARKIN", "She lied! She lied to us!"], ["DARTH VADER", "I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion."], ["TARKIN", "Terminate her... immediately!"], ["HAN", "Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines."], ["HAN", "What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts."], ["LUKE", "What's going on?"], ["HAN", "Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!"], ["LUKE", "What do you mean? Where is it?"], ["HAN", "Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away."], ["LUKE", "What? How?"], ["BEN", "Destroyed... by the Empire!"], ["HAN", "The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've..."], ["HAN", "There's another ship coming in."], ["LUKE", "Maybe they know what happened."], ["BEN", "It's an Imperial fighter."], ["LUKE", "It followed us!"], ["BEN", "No. It's a short range fighter."], ["HAN", "There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from?"], ["LUKE", "It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble."], ["HAN", "Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions."], ["BEN", "It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range."], ["HAN", "Not for long..."], ["BEN", "A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own."], ["LUKE", "It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something."], ["HAN", "Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us."], ["LUKE", "Look at him. He's headed for that small moon."], ["HAN", "I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range."], ["BEN", "That's no moon! It's a space station."], ["HAN", "It's too big to be a space station."], ["LUKE", "I have a very bad feeling about this."], ["HAN", "Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power."], ["LUKE", "Why are we still moving towards it?"], ["HAN", "We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!"], ["LUKE", "But there's gotta be something you can do!"], ["HAN", "There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight!"], ["BEN", "You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting."], ["OFFICER", "To you stations! (to another officer) Come with me."], ["OFFICER", "Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields!"], ["TARKIN", "Yes."], ["DARTH VADER", "They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us."], ["OFFICER", "(to Vader) There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned."], ["DARTH VADER", "Did you find any droids?"], ["OFFICER", "No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned."], ["DARTH VADER", "Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked."], ["OFFICER", "Yes, sir."], ["DARTH VADER", "I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since..."], ["OFFICER", "Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked!"], ["LUKE", "Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments."], ["HAN", "I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam."], ["BEN", "Leave that to me!"], ["HAN", "Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!"], ["BEN", "Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?"], ["TROOPER", "The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go."], ["HAN", "Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?"], ["GANTRY OFFICER", "TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy?"], ["GANTRY OFFICER", "Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do."], ["LUKE", "You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here."], ["HAN", "Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around."], ["THREEPIO", "We found the computer outlet, sir."], ["BEN", "Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network."], ["THREEPIO", "He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor."], ["THREEPIO", "The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave."], ["BEN", "I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone."], ["HAN", "Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already."], ["LUKE", "I want to go with you."], ["BEN", "Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids."], ["LUKE", "But he can..."], ["BEN", "They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you... always!"], ["HAN", "Boy you said it, Chewie."], ["HAN", "Where did you dig up that old fossil?"], ["LUKE", "Ben is a great man."], ["HAN", "Yeah, great at getting us into trouble."], ["LUKE", "I didn't hear you give any ideas..."], ["HAN", "Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up..."], ["LUKE", "Who do you think..."], ["LUKE", "What is it?"], ["THREEPIO", "I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says \"I found her\", and keeps repeating, \"She's here.\""], ["LUKE", "Well, who... who has he found?"], ["THREEPIO", "Princess Leia."], ["LUKE", "The princess? She's here?"], ["HAN", "Princess? What's going on?"], ["THREEPIO", "Level five. Detention block A A-twenty- three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated."], ["LUKE", "Oh, no! We've got to do something."], ["HAN", "What are you talking about?"], ["LUKE", "The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message... We've got to help her."], ["HAN", "Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here."], ["LUKE", "But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?"], ["HAN", "I'm not going anywhere."], ["LUKE", "They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay."], ["HAN", "Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind."], ["LUKE", "But they're going to kill her!"], ["HAN", "Better her than me..."], ["LUKE", "She's rich."], ["HAN", "Rich?"], ["LUKE", "Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be..."], ["HAN", "What?"], ["LUKE", "Well more wealth that you can imagine."], ["HAN", "I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!"], ["LUKE", "You'll get it!"], ["HAN", "I better!"], ["LUKE", "You will..."], ["HAN", "All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this."], ["LUKE", "All right."], ["HAN", "What's your plan?"], ["LUKE", "Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?"], ["LUKE", "Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you."], ["LUKE", "Okay. Han, you put these on."], ["HAN", "Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind."], ["THREEPIO", "Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?"], ["LUKE", "Lock the door!"], ["HAN", "And hope they don't have blasters."], ["THREEPIO", "That isn't very reassuring."], ["LUKE", "I can't see a thing in this helmet."], ["HAN", "This is not going to work."], ["LUKE", "Why didn't you say so before?"], ["HAN", "I did say so before!"], ["OFFICER", "Where are you taking this... thing?"], ["LUKE", "Prisoner transfer from Block one-one- three-eight."], ["OFFICER", "I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it."], ["HAN", "Look out! He's loose!"], ["LUKE", "He's going to pull us all apart."], ["HAN", "Go get him!"], ["HAN", "We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here."], ["HAN", "(sounding official) Everything is under control. Situation normal."], ["INTERCOM", "What happened?"], ["HAN", "(getting nervous) Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you?"], ["INTERCOM", "We're sending a squad up."], ["HAN", "Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous."], ["INTERCOM", "Who is this? What's your operating number?"], ["HAN", "Boring conversation anyway. (yelling down the hall) Luke! We're going to have company!"], ["LEIA", "(finally) Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?"], ["LUKE", "What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you."], ["LEIA", "You're who?"], ["LUKE", "I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi."], ["LEIA", "Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?"], ["LUKE", "Come on!"], ["DARTH VADER", "He is here..."], ["TARKIN", "Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so?"], ["DARTH VADER", "A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master."], ["TARKIN", "Surely he must be dead by now."], ["DARTH VADER", "Don't underestimate the power of the Force."], ["TARKIN", "The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion."], ["TARKIN", "Yes."], ["INTERCOM", "Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty- three."], ["TARKIN", "The princess! Put all sections on alert!"], ["DARTH VADER", "Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him."], ["TARKIN", "If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape."], ["DARTH VADER", "Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone."], ["HAN", "Chewie!"], ["HAN", "Get behind me! Get behind me!"], ["HAN", "Can't get out that way."], ["LEIA", "Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route."], ["HAN", "(sarcastically) Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness."], ["LUKE", "See-Threepio! See-Threepio!"], ["THREEPIO", "(over comlink) Yes sir?"], ["LUKE", "We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that? I didn't copy!"], ["THREEPIO", "I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted."], ["TROOPER", "Open up in there!"], ["THREEPIO", "Oh, no!"], ["LUKE", "There isn't any other way out."], ["HAN", "I can't hold them off forever! Now what?"], ["LEIA", "This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?"], ["HAN", "(pointing to Luke) He's the brains, sweetheart."], ["LUKE", "Well, I didn't..."], ["HAN", "What the hell are you doing?"], ["LEIA", "Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy."], ["HAN", "Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it."], ["HAN", "Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!"], ["HAN", "(sarcastically) Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there..."], ["LUKE", "No! wait!"], ["LUKE", "Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed!"], ["LEIA", "Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed."], ["HAN", "Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us."], ["LEIA", "It could be worse..."], ["HAN", "It's worse."], ["LUKE", "There's something alive in here!"], ["HAN", "That's your imagination."], ["LUKE", "Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that?"], ["HAN", "What?"], ["LUKE", "Help!"], ["HAN", "Luke! Luke! Luke!"], ["LEIA", "Luke!"], ["LEIA", "Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this."], ["LUKE", "Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed."], ["HAN", "Where?"], ["LUKE", "Anywhere! Oh!!"], ["HAN", "Luke! Luke!"], ["LEIA", "Grab him!"], ["LEIA", "What happened?"], ["LUKE", "I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared..."], ["HAN", "I've got a very bad feeling about this."], ["LUKE", "The walls are moving!"], ["LEIA", "Don't just stand there.

If you hurry, you might catch them."], ["FIRST OFFICER", "(to his troops) Follow me! You stand guard."], ["THREEPIO", "(to Artoo) Come on!"], ["THREEPIO", "Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance."], ["TROOPER", "All right."], ["LUKE", "Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!"], ["HAN", "Get to the top!"], ["LEIA", "I can't"], ["LUKE", "Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in?"], ["THREEPIO", "They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured."], ["THREEPIO", "Hurry!"], ["HAN", "One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner!

I forgot I turned it off!"], ["THREEPIO", "Are you there, sir?"], ["LUKE", "Threepio!"], ["THREEPIO", "We've had some problems..."], ["LUKE", "(over comlink) Will you shut up and listen to me?

I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?"], ["HAN", "Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me!"], ["LEIA", "It's a wonder you're still alive.

Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship."], ["LUKE", "We're right above you. Stand by."], ["LEIA", "You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought."], ["HAN", "Nice! Come on!"], ["FIRST TROOPER", "It's them! Blast them!"], ["HAN", "(to Luke and Leia) Get back to the ship!"], ["LUKE", "Where are you going?

You see, what happened to your father was my fault."], ["BEN", "Anakin was a good friend."], ["BEN", "When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot.

I couldn't do it."], ["BEN", "Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.

You would have been prepared."], ["LUKE", "But I had to help my friends."], ["BEN", "To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!"], ["LUKE", "I can't kill my own father."], ["BEN", "Then the Emperor has already won.

That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous."], ["LUKE", "Leia! Leia's my sister."], ["BEN", "Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor."], ["LUKE", "But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her."], ["BEN", "She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family.
